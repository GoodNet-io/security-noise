# Contract: Noise Handshake

**Status:** active · v1
**Owner:** `plugins/security/noise/`
**Implements:** `gn_security_provider_vtable_t` from `sdk/security.h`
**Stability:** wire-incompatible changes require a new protocol-name suffix.

---

## 1. Purpose

This contract pins the cryptographic surface of the canonical
security provider: handshake pattern, hash function, buffer
sizing, and rekey semantics. v1 ships one pattern:

| Pattern | When used | Identity |
|---|---|---|
| `Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2b` | unknown peer, mutual auth | both sides Ed25519 keys |

The protocol name string is the **on-wire** name; the implementation
**must** match it exactly. A name string that disagrees with the
actual hash function produces wire-incompatible peers — no external
Noise stack will interoperate.

A v1.1 sibling provider (`noise-ik`) registers under a distinct
`provider_id` and adds the `Noise_IK_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2b`
pattern for the initiator-knows-peer-pk case. Selection between
providers happens through `register_security` per
`docs/contracts/security-trust.md`, not through a runtime selector inside this
provider's vtable.

## 1a. Prologue (domain separation)

Both sides mix the literal byte string `"goodnet/v1/noise"` into
the symmetric handshake hash immediately after `InitializeSymmetric`
per Noise §6.5. The prologue binds the handshake transcript to
the GoodNet protocol context: an Ed25519 message that happens to
share a transcript prefix with an XX run cannot be replayed as
the start of a hostile handshake because the prefix bytes
disagree with the prologue.

The string changes when the wire format changes. A v1.x
extension that needs a fresh transcript domain bumps the prologue
to `"goodnet/v1.x/noise"` (or further) — Noise transcripts under
two different prologues never collide.

---

## 2. Hash function

`BLAKE2b` (512-bit output, `HASHLEN = 64`) is mandatory across all three
patterns. The implementation **must**:

1. Match the protocol-name string (§1).
2. Produce 64-byte digests (`HASHLEN = 64`).
3. Pass the Noise reference test vectors for
   `Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2b` — included in the
   property-test suite.

The choice of BLAKE2b over BLAKE2s comes from libsodium availability:
`crypto_generichash_blake2b` is the canonical primitive in our
dependency stack, BLAKE2s is not exposed. BLAKE2b is faster than BLAKE2s
on 64-bit platforms and provides a strictly larger security margin.

`HASHLEN = 64` is asserted at compile time. The cipher key size for the
ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher is fixed at 32 bytes (`GN_CIPHER_KEY_BYTES`);
when the symmetric state derives a cipher key from a 64-byte chaining
material via `MixKey`, the first 32 bytes are taken per Noise spec §5.2.

The exposed `gn_handshake_keys_t::handshake_hash` field carries 32 bytes
for channel binding — the SDK ABI uses `GN_HASH_BYTES = 32` here, and
the plugin truncates the 64-byte `h` to its first 32 bytes on export.
Channel binding security is preserved (256-bit collision-resistance).

---

## 3. Handshake buffer sizing

The handshake state machine produces messages up to about 96
bytes for `XX`. A fixed-size stack buffer paired with an
unbounded write call is unsafe — a peer who provokes an oversized
prologue triggers a stack-buffer overflow, an RCE-class hazard
on any public listener.

The contract: **handshake message buffers are heap-allocated and
size-bounded by the call site, not the source-code-fixed buffer
size.** The cost over a stack buffer is one allocation per handshake
message (~50 ns); negligible against the 1–10 ms the handshake
itself consumes for X25519 plus ChaCha20.

C ABI signatures **must not** accept a fixed-size output buffer
without an out-parameter for the actual length:

| Signature | Permitted |
|---|---|
| `noise_write(state, payload, payload_size, out_buf, out_cap, out_size*)` | yes — caller-provided cap, kernel-checked |
| `noise_write(state, payload, out_size)` writing into a hidden buffer | yes — opaque ownership, paired free |
| `noise_write(state, payload, out_buf)` — no cap, no out-size | **no** — unverifiable |

The first form is what we ship.

---

## 4. Rekey

Both transport ciphers (send and receive) rekey when nonce reaches
the threshold:

```
REKEY_INTERVAL = 2^60
```

Matching the WireGuard threshold. A lower interval would force rekey
on every bulk transfer and amplify any nonce-handling bug.

If `rekey()` did not reset the nonce on both ciphers atomically, two
peers running it mid-flight would diverge — sender on key `k+1`,
receiver still on `k` — and decrypt would silently fail until the
next explicit handshake.

The contract:

```
rekey():
    derive_next_keys(send_cipher, recv_cipher)
    send_cipher.nonce = 0
    recv_cipher.nonce = 0
```

Both ciphers rekey atomically with paired nonce reset.

### 4.1 Auto-trigger inside encrypt / decrypt

The provider checks the threshold inside every `encrypt` and
`decrypt` call after advancing the nonce. When either CipherState
crosses `REKEY_INTERVAL` the provider runs `rekey()` on the
`TransportState` before returning, so the next call to the same
slot sees the fresh keys and reset nonces.

Both peers reach the threshold symmetrically — every encrypt by
the local side advances the peer's recv counter by one, and the
recv counter rekeys at the same point. The two sides converge
without an out-of-band signal and without a kernel-managed
scheduler.

The `NoiseTransportRekey.SymmetricThresholdRekeyKeepsInterop`
test pushes both counters to one short of the threshold,
exchanges a frame on each direction, and asserts continued
decrypt against the fresh keys.

---

## 5. Key zeroisation

After `export_transport_keys` succeeds, the source session keys are
no longer needed. Leaving copies in memory after their purpose
expires weakens forward secrecy on every byte that outlives that
purpose.

The contract:

1. `export_transport_keys` zeroises every cipher key, nonce, and
   hash buffer in the source session after copying out.
2. After export, the source session's encrypt/decrypt entries return
   `GN_ERR_INVALID_STATE`. Reuse is rejected.
3. The inline-crypto state zeroises its own keys when destroyed.
4. The handshake state's `Split` step zeroises every secret buffer
   inside the handshake state at the moment the transport ciphers
   are produced. The set is the long-term static private key, the
   ephemeral private key, the ephemeral public key, the peer
   ephemeral key, and the symmetric chaining key. After `Split`
   returns, no further pattern message can be processed
   (`is_complete()` is true), so none of these buffers have any
   remaining purpose. The handshake hash stays readable for channel
   binding and is wiped only at destruction. The destructor
   re-zeroises every key buffer as a defence-in-depth backstop; in
   the steady-state path the destructor sees buffers already
   cleared by `Split`.

   The eager wipe is exception-safe: if the underlying split
   primitive throws (allocation failure, primitive failure), every
   secret buffer is zeroised before the exception propagates. The
   transport ciphers are not produced; the caller observes the
   exception and discards the handshake state.

   The eager wipe is also move-safe. The handshake state and its
   embedded symmetric state both implement custom move construction
   and move assignment that zeroise the moved-from source's secret
   buffers after the bytes are transferred. A caller that moves a
   live handshake state into another container leaves the source
   with empty secret buffers — the move ends the source's lifetime
   for cryptographic purposes.

How a language zeroises memory is internal to the binding (libsodium
`sodium_memzero` in C/C++; equivalent secure-erase primitives
elsewhere). The observable contract is that keys are not present in
process memory after the documented destruction point.

---

## 5b. Cross-plugin application

The end-of-life hygiene formalised in §5 applies to every long-lived
secret buffer the GoodNet codebase owns. The clauses are
canonical for Noise; other plugins follow the same pattern through
their own destructors and reassignment paths:

- A long-lived secret buffer is zeroised at the destruction point
  of the owning object.
- A reassignment of the same buffer zeroises the previous bytes
  before the new bytes are written, so a shorter replacement does
  not leave a tail of the old secret in process memory.
- After the buffer's cryptographic purpose ends, the buffer is
  wiped — the destructor remains as a defence-in-depth backstop.

The TLS transport's server private key buffer follows this pattern:
the override storage is zeroised on destruction, on reassignment
through `set_server_credentials`, and after the OpenSSL context has
loaded the bytes in `load_server_credentials`. The cert buffer is
public material and is exempt from the wipe rule.

## 5a. `gn_handshake_keys_t` layout

The provider populates this struct in `export_transport_keys` and
zeroises its own copy on return. The caller reads the values once
to seed the transport-phase cipher state. The struct is
caller-allocated; the provider never retains a pointer past the
export call.

```c
#define GN_CIPHER_KEY_BYTES   32  /* ChaCha20 key */
#define GN_HASH_BYTES         32  /* channel-binding hash */
#define GN_PUBLIC_KEY_BYTES   32  /* peer Ed25519 public key */

typedef struct gn_handshake_keys_s {
    uint8_t  send_cipher_key[GN_CIPHER_KEY_BYTES];
    uint8_t  recv_cipher_key[GN_CIPHER_KEY_BYTES];
    uint64_t initial_send_nonce;
    uint64_t initial_recv_nonce;
    uint8_t  handshake_hash[GN_HASH_BYTES];
    uint8_t  peer_static_pk[GN_PUBLIC_KEY_BYTES];
    void*    _reserved[4];
} gn_handshake_keys_t;
```

| Field | Width | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `send_cipher_key` | 32 bytes | symmetric ChaCha20 key for outgoing frames |
| `recv_cipher_key` | 32 bytes | symmetric ChaCha20 key for incoming frames |
| `initial_send_nonce` | u64 | first nonce the inline-crypto path uses on send |
| `initial_recv_nonce` | u64 | first nonce the inline-crypto path expects on receive |
| `handshake_hash` | 32 bytes | channel-binding (BLAKE2b-256 over the symmetric-state `h` per §2); attestation §2 binds against this value |
| `peer_static_pk` | 32 bytes | peer's Ed25519 public key learned during handshake; the kernel uses it for routing decisions and trust upgrade |
| `_reserved[4]` | 32 bytes | NULL on init; size-prefix evolution per `abi-evolution.md` §4 |

## 6. Nonce initialisation

Inline-crypto state initialises send and receive nonces from
explicit fields in the handshake-result structure. Hard-coding the
initial value at construction would create a one-message gap between
the vtable-encrypt path (which uses the stored nonce) and the
inline-crypto path — a bug that hides on the steady state and
surfaces at rekey transitions.

The contract: every inline-crypto field that has a corresponding
`gn_handshake_keys_t::initial_*` field **must** be wired through.
If a field is always zero, it is removed from `gn_handshake_keys_t`
rather than left as unused state.

---

## 7. Wire format on the encrypted side

A Noise frame on the wire:

```
offset  size            field
------  --------------  --------------------------------------------------
  0     2               ciphertext length, big-endian uint16
  2     length - 16     ciphertext (ChaCha20-Poly1305 with associated data)
  N-16  16              authentication tag (Poly1305)
```

Length is a 16-bit unsigned because the post-decryption plaintext
(the GNET frame; see `plugins/protocols/gnet/docs/wire-format.md`) is bounded by the GNET
layer maximum. Larger payloads are pre-fragmented at the kernel
level before reaching the security layer.

The associated data is empty for v1 — the framing layer carries its
own MAC implicitly via the included header bytes inside the
ciphertext. A future v2 may introduce associated data for forward-
error-correction support; a `ver` bump in GNET (not Noise) signals
that.

### 7a. Length-prefix ownership

The 2-byte length prefix is emitted and consumed by the kernel-side
`SecuritySession` wrapper, not by the provider's encrypt/decrypt
vtable slots. Provider implementations operate on bare ciphertext:
`encrypt(plaintext) → cipher+tag`, `decrypt(cipher+tag) → plaintext`.
The session prepends the length on outbound and slices each
`length`-byte ciphertext range off the per-conn inbound buffer
before invoking the provider's `decrypt`. This split keeps the
provider vtable narrow (single AEAD primitive, no framing state)
while letting one kernel-side framer work for every provider —
noise, null, future post-quantum.

The kernel-side fast path additionally bypasses the vtable: when
`export_transport_keys` returns non-zero cipher keys, the session
seeds an inline-crypto state per §6 and runs ChaCha20-Poly1305
directly on the keys. The provider's transport-phase encrypt /
decrypt vtable slots remain populated for fallback when a provider
declines to export keys (returns `GN_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`); they
are not called on the noise hot path.

---

## 7a. Transport invariants required by this provider

The Noise transport ciphers consume a 64-bit nonce that
increments deterministically on every encrypt / decrypt call —
the security session does not maintain a replay window because
the v1 deployment relies on its underlying transport to deliver
each frame **at most once and in order**. The provider is
correct on a transport that satisfies the following:

| Invariant | Required by |
|---|---|
| **Reliable delivery** — every frame either reaches the peer or the connection is torn down | the symmetric-rekey schedule in §4 — a silently dropped frame leaves the two sides on diverging counters and breaks the next AEAD authentication |
| **In-order delivery** — frames arrive in the order they were sent | the receive nonce is implicit; a re-ordered frame fails AEAD authentication and the connection is torn down |
| **No replay at the link layer** — the same frame is not delivered twice | the nonce check at decrypt would reject the second copy, but the kernel-side metric attribution would log a spurious authentication failure |

TCP, TLS-over-TCP, IPC, and WS satisfy all three. UDP-class
transports do not — datagram delivery is best-effort and
unordered — and the v1 noise provider therefore does not run on
top of them: a UDP-class link plugin pairing with this provider
will see its first re-ordered or duplicate frame fail AEAD
authentication, the kernel tears the connection down, and the
peer reconnects through a fresh handshake. A future provider
extension that targets UDP-class transports must dedup at the
frame layer (separate replay window per security session) before
reaching the AEAD; that work is deferred to v1.1 and tracked in
the rc1 release notes.

---

## 8. Identity binding

The Ed25519 static keys used for Noise handshakes are the same keys
the mesh layer uses as addresses. There is no separate "transport
key" authority — `pk` is the address, the same `pk` is the Noise
static.

The address is an Ed25519 public key (32 bytes); the Noise suite
suffix `25519` denotes X25519 for Diffie-Hellman. Each side's static
key crosses curves at session initialisation — the security provider
applies the standard birational map (libsodium
`crypto_sign_ed25519_pk_to_curve25519` for the public half,
`crypto_sign_ed25519_sk_to_curve25519` for the secret half) before
the key enters the Noise state machine. The conversion is one-way and
lives inside the security provider; the kernel and handlers see only
the Ed25519 representation.

After a successful Noise handshake:

1. The transport called `host_api->notify_connect` at the moment
   the socket established, with `trust` derived from the address
   (per `docs/contracts/link.md` §3 — `Loopback` for `127.0.0.1`/`::1`/
   AF_UNIX, `Untrusted` for public). Trust class **stays
   `Untrusted`** when the handshake reaches the Transport phase —
   completing the cryptographic handshake proves the peer holds
   the static key but not that the kernel should treat the peer
   as a `Peer`-class participant. The promotion to `Peer` is
   gated by the attestation dual-flag protocol per
   `docs/contracts/attestation.md` §6, which fires after both sides exchange a
   valid attestation envelope; `Loopback` and `IntraNode`
   connections never upgrade — `gn_trust_can_upgrade` in
   `sdk/trust.h` refuses any other transition.
2. The endpoint's `pk` is set to the peer's static public key,
   copied from the handshake-result structure.
3. Subsequent envelopes from this connection carry that `pk` as
   `sender_pk` (via the protocol layer's `ConnectionContext`).

Mid-flight identity change is impossible — ChaCha20-Poly1305 would
fail to authenticate any frame signed with a different static.
